\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Scope of this document}
This user guide intends to give an overview of the Nux's design and how to use it in hardware designs and for executing software on it.
\textbf{It is not (yet) a full specification.}
It should serve as a starting point for everyone wanting to contribute to the design and provide the necessary knowledge to use it in other hardware designs.

\section{Related material}
Most of the internals are documented in detail in \cite{friedmann13phd}.
Some overview of the vector \gls{simd} unit and the use for plasticity is given in \cite{dlspaper15}.
